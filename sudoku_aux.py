# This script contains functions I have defined to help make my Su Doku solver

# Aim: clock sudoku.

# When Sudoku-mania swept the globe in the mid-2000s, many mathematicians, programmers
# and computer scientists  amateur and professional  started to
# investigate Sudoku itself. They were less interested in solving individual puzzles,
# and more focused on asking and answering mathematical and/or computational questions
# about the entire universe of Sudoku puzzles and solutions.
